### Hey!

I'm Aaron Yoder. I study theoretical mathematics and algorithms, and have been programming for well over a decade now.

# FAQ

### What operating system do you use on desktop?

I use Windows 10 on my personal computers, but there's something really charming about Linux. I can't bring myself to jump over to Linux permanently yet, though.

### What operating system do you use on mobile?

Android. I currently use a Pixel 3a on the latest version of Android.

### What's your preferred browser?

[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) on all platforms.

### What are your favorite programming languages?

Java.

I've used Kotlin and like some of the features it has, but I personally think that it obscures too much in the name of null safety. Null safety is really only an issue in Java if you follow poor practices. Having worked with others directly on Kotlin code, Kotlin allows you to much more easily fall into very bad practices that lead to poor readability and poor stability. Contrary to what seems to be popular belief, less code does not always equal more readability. I think Kotlin is great for personal projects that you want to iterate quickly on, but I think it's currently a poor language choice for team projects.

Other languages I've used in the past are BASIC, Lua, C, C++, C#, Python, Haskell, and JavaScript.

### What languages are you learning right now?

Rust and Haskell. Of course, I'm still always learning new things about Java as well!

This isn't a programming language, but I'm also continually brushing up on my German.

### Preferred IDE?

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

### What are some of your other interests?

I enjoy all things mathematical, including algorithms and cryptography. I also do photography and astronomy as a hobby, and sometimes combine the two through astrophotography! Coffee is also big in my life, and I'm always trying to brew a better cup. I also love playing video games, especially Nintendo games.
