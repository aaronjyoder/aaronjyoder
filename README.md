### Hey!

I'm Aaron Yoder. I study theoretical mathematics and algorithms, and have been programming for well over a decade now.

# FAQ

### What operating system do you use on desktop?

I use Windows 10 on my personal computers, but there's something really charming about Linux. I can't bring myself to jump over to Linux permanently yet, though.

### What operating system do you use on mobile?

Android. I currently use a Pixel 3a on the latest version of Android.

### What's your preferred browser?

[Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) on all platforms.

### What are your favorite programming languages?

Java.

I've used Kotlin and like some of the features it has, but I still prefer Java and the direction it is currently headed.

Other languages I've used in the past include, but are not limited to, BASIC, Lua, C, C++, C#, Python, Haskell, and JavaScript.

### What languages are you learning right now?

Rust and Haskell. Of course, I'm still always learning new things about Java as well!

This isn't a programming language, but I'm also continually brushing up on my German.

### Preferred IDE?

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

### What are some of your other interests?

I enjoy all things mathematical, including algorithms and cryptography. I also do photography and astronomy as a hobby, and sometimes combine the two through astrophotography! Coffee is also big in my life, and I'm always trying to brew a better cup. I also love playing video games, especially Nintendo games.
